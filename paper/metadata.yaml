abstract: |
    We propose a way to use blockchain technologies as a simulation medium, where instead of tokens there are atoms, instead of a hashing algorithm there is a physics engine, and instead of blocks there are temporal frames of a continuous simulation. As an initial use-case, we focus on cellular simulation and its applications in medical research. Much of this proposal is speculative and is intended as a starting point for further discussion.
